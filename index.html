              To protect your property, we encourage you to remove window coverings, furniture, wall hangings and other personal belongings from areas
              leading to, and immediately surrounding, where work will be performed. Apex Window Werks USA will not be responsible for damage to
              personal property that has not been removed from these areas. To ensure proper scheduling of your service, please advise our office if
              you will require assistance with removal and replacement of these items when placing your order. Depending on the amount of additional
              employee time required, there may be an additional charge for this service. <br />
              <br />
              In some cases, a window's trim (glazing bead/stop) or other components may have become weak and/or brittle due to exposure or may be
              overly adhered to the window glass or frame. While we take great care in the removal and replacement of these parts, damage may be
              unavoidable. Unless otherwise indicated on this quote, the replacement of these parts is not included. If replacement is required, Apex
              Window Werks USA will supply the replacement parts for an additional cost. Exact match parts may or may not be available.
              <br />
              <br />
              Allow 24 hours before using windows (opening and closing) after silicone and caulking were applied. If windows were used before 24 hours
              and silicone or caulking was compromised Apex Window Werks will reapply it for an additional charge.
              <br />

              Painting job includes an only part which was replaced or repaired by Apex Window Werks USA, complimentary and is not subject to
